I am a Master's student in mathematical statistics at Stockholm University. 
Currently, my interests lie within causal inference, data science and philosophy. 

## Publications

I stayed for one semester at the Australian National University where I wrote my 
bachelor thesis. I was supervised by [Marcus Hutter](http://www.hutter1.net/) and [Tom Everitt](https://www.tomeveritt.se/).

My bachelor thesis is related to game theory. We investigate different ways of classifying games and
develop a novel approach for the classification of symmetric 2x2 games.

* [Classification by Decomposition: A Partitioning of the Space of 2X2 Symmetric Games](http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1106499&dswid=-199) 

An article version of the thesis is currently under review. 

* Draft: [Classification by Decomposition
A novel approach to classification of symmetric 2 × 2 games](./article.pdf)

During my stay I also co-authored the following article related to a corrigibility 
problem in Artifical Intelligence safety research. 
We propose a game theoretic approach to analysing the off-switch game dynamic. 

* [A Game-Theoretic Analysis of the Off-Switch Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03871)

I also gave a talk at the [PT-AI conference](https://www.pt-ai.org/2017) presenting the article above,
here are the [slides](./PTAI-talk.pdf).
